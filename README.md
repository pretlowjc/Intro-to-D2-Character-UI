# Welcome to Mr Arkaine's Beginner's Guide to Understanding Destiny 2's Character UI


This is a beginner's guide to understanding Destiny 2's character ui and how to use it. This guide is meant for those of you who do not understand something within the UI or are completely new to the game. If you are new to the game, this is a great place to start before diving into the complexity and mechanics of the game. 

**Where to Begin?**

To start off, lets look in the top left of the character's ui. There you will see 

**Element System**

Lets explain the element system. There are three elements. Arc (orange), Solar (blue), and Void (purple). Each are depicted below from the subclass selection portion of the character's ui.

During gameplay in a PvE (player vs environment) environment, you can match the elemnts to the enemies shields if they have one and you will do more damage, breaking the enemies shield sooner versus using the wrong element or none at all. In higher tier gameplay this becomes a bit more important due to some modifiers within the game. This will be discussed in another guide at a later point.
