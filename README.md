# Welcome to Mr Arkaine's Beginner's Guide to Understanding Destiny 2's Character UI


This is a beginner's guide to understanding Destiny 2's character ui and how to use it. This guide is meant for those of you who do not understand something within the UI or are completely new to the game. If you are new to the game, this is a great place to start before diving into the complexity and mechanics of the game. 

**Where to Begin?**

To start off, when you start up your game for the first time you will come across the steps to creating your character. First, you will choose which class you would like to be. You can choose from one of three classes. 

**Titan**

*"Disciplined and proud, Titans are capable of both aggressive assaults and stalwart defenses."*

**Hunter**

*"Agile and daring, Hunters are quick on their feet and quicker on the draw."

**Warlock** 

*"Warlocks weaponize the mysteries of the universe to sustain themselves and devastate their foes."*


Lets look in the top left of the character's ui. There you will see four things. You will see a first the your name. Whether it be your gamertag, steam name, or your Playstation ID, these will be all there where the highlighted item is below.

Next you will see your season rank right below. This season rank number directly corresponds how far along you have progressed through the season pass. I will likely explain how this works at a later given point in another guide on it's own.

Next, to the right of that you will see your characters power level. Your power level can increase and decrease depending on the individual power levels of the gear you are currently wearing. I will go more into the detail as I cover the power level portion of the ui.

Lastly, you will come across your triumph score. Your triumph score is a total score of all of the triumphs you have completed. The more you complete, the higher your score will be. You can increase your triumph score by completing activies or challenges located within the triumphs tab located at the top of your character ui.

**Element System**

Lets explain the element system. There are three elements. *Arc* (orange), *Solar* (blue), and *Void* (purple). Each are depicted below from the subclass selection portion of the character's ui.

During gameplay in a PvE (player vs environment) environment, you can match the elemnts to the enemies shields if they have one and you will do more damage, breaking the enemies shield sooner versus using the wrong element or none at all. In higher tier gameplay this becomes a bit more important due to some modifiers within the game. This will be discussed in another guide at a later point.
