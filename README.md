# Welcome to Mr Arkaine's Beginner's Guide to Understanding Destiny 2's Character UI


This is a beginner's guide to understanding Destiny 2's character ui and how to use it. This guide is meant for those of you who do not understand something within the UI or are completely new to the game. If you are new to the game, this is a great place to start before diving into the complexity and mechanics of the game. 

**Where to Begin?**

To start off, when you start up your game for the first time you will come across the steps to creating your character. First, you will choose which class you would like to be. You can choose from one of three classes. 

**Titan**

*"Disciplined and proud, Titans are capable of both aggressive assaults and stalwart defenses."*

**Hunter**

*"Agile and daring, Hunters are quick on their feet and quicker on the draw."*

**Warlock** 

*"Warlocks weaponize the mysteries of the universe to sustain themselves and devastate their foes."*

Next you will then choose your character's race and gender, then customize your face, hair, and markings. I will let you go through this when you start up the game and if you would like any lore, stories, and or explanation behind each race you can find it on the Destiny 2 Wiki where they explain it in depth. Simply follow the link below then hover above CHARACTERS and select Species.

After the introduction to Destiny 2's story and an some gameplay you will finally have a chance to take a look into the character ui. I believe that they give a brief introduction into what everything is but this guide goes a little further in depth. 

**Now Taking a Look into the Character's UI**


Lets look in the top left of the character's ui. There you will see four things. You will see your name located here. Whether it be your Gamertag, Steam Name/ID, or your Playstation ID, these will be all there where the highlighted item is below.

![Character UI Name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233173-e21c7500-17b4-11eb-81f8-74e9dd6f88b2.png)

Next you will see your season rank right below. This season rank number directly corresponds how far along you have progressed through the season pass. I will likely explain how this works at a later given point in another guide on it's own.

![Character UI Season Rank](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233525-7a1a5e80-17b5-11eb-81c1-49b9a9a60825.png)

Next, to the right of that you will see your characters power level. Your power level can increase and decrease depending on the individual power levels of the gear you are currently wearing. I will go more into the detail as I cover the power level portion of the ui.

![Character UI Power Level Top Left](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233699-c4034480-17b5-11eb-8e2d-1c800a80907d.png)

Lastly, you will come across your triumph score. Your triumph score is a total score of all of the triumphs you have completed. The more you complete, the higher your score will be. You can increase your triumph score by completing activies or challenges located within the triumphs tab located at the top of your character ui.

![Character UI Triumph Score](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233853-12b0de80-17b6-11eb-8433-953f9524dcb6.png)

**Glimmer**

Glimmer is the in game currency used to mod and craft weapons and armor.

![Character UI Glimmer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97349593-08e6b400-1866-11eb-9d36-499442f1fdc2.png)

**Legendary Shards**

Legendary shards are another currency type that is used to purchase Exotic weapons from Xur, and armor and weapons from other vendors. Besides that, they are used to improve gear.

![Character UI Legendary Shards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97350105-b6f25e00-1866-11eb-919f-2e2f41587be1.png)

**Silver**

Silver is an in game currency that is actual real money. This can be purchased from either the Xbox store, Playstation store, or on Steam if you are on PC. This currency is really only used to buy cosmetics from Eververse, which I would not worry about in the beginning at all.

![Character UI Silver](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97350290-ef923780-1866-11eb-9e83-577988a841ab.png)

**Bright Dust**

Bright dust is used to buy cosmetics from Eververse and can be earned by playing the game.

![Character UI Bright Dust](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97350716-249e8a00-1867-11eb-98ef-b51f52db9fd9.png)

This explains what is located at the top of the character ui besides the navigation bar, which I believe is somewhat self explanatory.

**Element System**

Before explaining the subclasses lets explain the element system. There are three elements. *Arc* (orange), *Solar* (blue), and *Void* (purple). Each are depicted below from the subclass selection portion of the character's ui. 

![Character UI Element Explanation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97231248-99af8800-17b1-11eb-8a8e-e311918e238d.png)

During gameplay in a PvE (player vs environment) environment, you can match the elemnts to the enemies shields if they have one and you will do more damage, breaking the enemies shield sooner versus using the wrong element or none at all. In higher tier gameplay this becomes a bit more important due to some modifiers within the game. This will be discussed in another guide at a later point.

**Subclasses**

![Character UI Subclass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97235647-b18b0a00-17b9-11eb-9e42-0ca6f1eaa9cc.png)

For each class, you have three subclasses, which also have three different paths with their own unique abilities. This means you have the Titan, Warlock, and Hunter, which each have Arc, Solar, and Void subclasses, and each of those have three different paths. This alone can be very confusing so I am going to make another guide for this as well explaining what each do, and what to pick and why.

To continue, each of these specific subclasses and paths have their own names when you go to select a subclass to play as. Simply hover over one of the subclasses and select it, then you can change what path, ablities, grenade, and the jump.

![Character UI Subclass Detailed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236639-e304d500-17bb-11eb-9794-564a1fb6e643.png)

**Class Abilities**

![Character UI Subclass Abilities](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236630-dbddc700-17bb-11eb-90cf-dbb0dbed4d8e.png)

Each class has their own unique abilities as well. You have two options to choose from when selecting a ability and each has a brief description explaining what each does. The Titan uses a barricade to shield them from incoming damage, the Hunter has a dodge that either reloads your weapon or recharges your melee ability, and then the Warlock has a rift which either heals you as you stand in it or increases weapon damage.

**Grenades**

![Character UI Subclass Grenades](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236675-fd3eb300-17bb-11eb-81e8-74b4c4ae81aa.png)

For each class, you have three grenades to choose from and each does their own unique thing. Just mess around and see which you like or prefer. Though some are better than others or are simply more viable and easier to use.

**Movement Modes / Jump**

![Character UI Subclass Jump](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236685-062f8480-17bc-11eb-917a-19ae367f647b.png)

Again, for each class you have three of these to choose from and each is a bit different. Either giving you better movement in air, better control, or more lift. This is personal preference but you will find that as you play there are situational advantages to each. 

**Super Abilities**

![Character UI Subclass Trees](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236701-0b8ccf00-17bc-11eb-89dd-bc500225f9c6.png)

During gameplay you can use an ultimate/super ability which allows the player to use offensive, defensive, or support powers. You can find videos explaining which are best in what situations but I will go over this in a later guide as well.

**Weapon System**

So now, we're going to dive into the weapon system. I am for now going to keep it simple. But you have the following main weapon types.

*NOTE: There are some exotics that will fit into some categories they normally wouldn't. An example would be Eriana's Vow. This weapon is a Hand Cannon but it uses green/special ammo. There are others like this as well for the Heavy category.*

* Primary (Uses the white/primary ammo that drops)
  * Assault Rifle
  * Hand Cannon
  * Pulse Rifle
  * Bow
  * Submachine Gun
  * Sidearm
  
* Secondary (Uses the green/special ammo that drops)
  * Grenade Launcher
  * Fusion Rifle
  * Sniper Rifle
  * Shotgun
  * Trace Rifle
  
* Heavy/Power (Uses the purple/heavy ammo)
  * Machine Gun
  * Sword
  * Grenade Launcher 
  * Sniper Rifle
  * Shotgun
  * Rocket Launcher
  * Linear Fusion Rifle
  
*NOTE: There are different types or archetypes of each of these weapons. They each perform differently. Some will fire slower, do more DPS, or have some special trait like shooting three to five round bursts each time you pull the trigger. I will cover this at a later point discussing which weapons are best in slot and link DPS charts as well.*
  
With the weapon system in Destiny 2, Primary and Secondary weapons can fit into either or the Kinetic slot or the Energy slot. The heavy weapons listed above stay the same.

**Kinetic Weapons**

![Character UI Kinetic Weapon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97347978-e81d5f00-1863-11eb-8596-7dc3f7555c6d.png)

Weapons in the Kinetic slot do not have an elemental burn attached to them. The weapons that fit into this category are Secondary and Primary weapons. 

**Energy Weapons**

![Character UI Energy Weapon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97348171-2dda2780-1864-11eb-895c-5d73d86dabb1.png)

Weapons in this slot have an elemental burn. They can be one of the three that we previously talked about in the beginning. The weapons that fit into this category are the Primary and the Secondary weapon types.

**Heavy Weapons** 

![Character UI Power Weapon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97348590-bbb61280-1864-11eb-918d-dd7c1babc67a.png)

These weapons are going to be the ones I listed above in the Heavy/Power category. They only use the heavy (purple) ammo that drops. These weapons normally do a lot of damage and DPS. They can be used during boss phases and or killing supers within the crucible (PvP/Player versus Player).

You can do various different builds with each of these weapons to optimize your performance during gameplay. Normally you want to use at least one Primary weapon, one secondary weapon, and then one Heavy, which technically you can't avoid because this slot doesn't move nor take any weapons from the other categories. Another way you can play is simply using two Primary weapons and then a Heavy. Honestly, this is just personal preference. To start off, just play the game and find weapons you like to use.
