# Introduction

This is a beginner's guide to understanding Destiny 2's character UI and how to use it. This guide is meant for those who do not understand something within the UI. Or maybe you are entirely new to the game. If you are new to the game, this is a great place to start before diving into the game's complexity and mechanics. 

# Where to Begin

To start, when you start up your game for the first time, you will come across the steps to creating your character. First, you will choose which class you would like to be. You can choose from one of three classes. 

**Titan**

*"Disciplined and proud, Titans are capable of both aggressive assaults and stalwart defenses."*

**Hunter**

*"Agile and daring, Hunters are quick on their feet and quicker on the draw."*

**Warlock** 

*"Warlocks weaponize the mysteries of the universe to sustain themselves and devastate their foes."*

Next, you will choose your character's race and gender, then customize your face, hair, and markings. I will let you go through this when you start up the game. If you would like any lore, stories, and or explanation behind each race, you can find it on the Destiny 2 Wiki, where they explain it in depth. Follow the link below, then hover above CHARACTERS and select Species.

After being introduced to Destiny 2's story and some gameplay, you will finally have a chance to take a look into the character UI. They give a brief introduction into what everything is but this guide goes a little further in-depth. 

# Now Taking a Look into the UI


Let's look at the top left of the character's UI. There you will see four things. You will see your name located here. Whether it be your Gamertag, Steam Name/ID, or your Playstation ID, these will be all there where the highlighted item is below.

![Character UI Name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233173-e21c7500-17b4-11eb-81f8-74e9dd6f88b2.png)

Next, you will see your season rank right below. This season rank number directly corresponds to how far along you have progressed through the season pass. I will likely explain how this works at a later given point in another guide on its own.

![Character UI Season Rank](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233525-7a1a5e80-17b5-11eb-81c1-49b9a9a60825.png)

Next, to the right of that, you will see your character's power level. Your power level can increase and decrease depending on the individual power levels of the gear you are currently wearing. I will go more into detail as I cover the power level portion of the UI.

![Character UI Power Level Top Left](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233699-c4034480-17b5-11eb-8e2d-1c800a80907d.png)

Lastly, you will come across your triumph score. Your triumph score is a total score of all of the triumphs you have completed. The more you complete, the higher your score will be. You can increase your triumph score by completing activities or challenges located within the triumphs tab at the top of your character UI.

![Character UI Triumph Score](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97233853-12b0de80-17b6-11eb-8433-953f9524dcb6.png)

**Glimmer**

Glimmer is the in-game currency used to mod and craft weapons and armor.

![Character UI Glimmer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97349593-08e6b400-1866-11eb-9d36-499442f1fdc2.png)

**Legendary Shards**

Legendary shards are another currency type used to purchase Exotic weapons from Xur and armor and other vendors' weapons. Besides that, they are used to improve gear.

![Character UI Legendary Shards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97350105-b6f25e00-1866-11eb-919f-2e2f41587be1.png)

**Silver**

Silver is an in-game currency that is real money. You can purchase Silver from either the Xbox Store, Playstation Store, or Steam if you are on PC. This currency is only used to buy cosmetics from Eververse, which I would not worry about in the beginning at all.

![Character UI Silver](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97350290-ef923780-1866-11eb-9e83-577988a841ab.png)

**Bright Dust**

Bright dust is used to buy cosmetics from Eververse and can be earned by playing the game.

![Character UI Bright Dust](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97350716-249e8a00-1867-11eb-98ef-b51f52db9fd9.png)

This explains what is located at the top of the character UI besides the navigation bar, which I believe is somewhat self-explanatory.

# Element System

Before explaining the subclasses, let's clarify the element system. There are three elements. Arc (orange), Solar (blue), and Void (purple). Each is depicted below from the subclass selection portion of the character's UI.

![Character UI Element Explanation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97231248-99af8800-17b1-11eb-8a8e-e311918e238d.png)

During gameplay in a PvE (player vs. environment) environment, you can match the elements to the enemies' shields if they have one. You will do more damage, breaking the enemies' shield sooner versus using the wrong element or none at all. In higher tier gameplay, this becomes a bit more important due to some modifiers within the game. This will be discussed in another guide at a later point.

# Subclasses

![Character UI Subclass](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97235647-b18b0a00-17b9-11eb-9e42-0ca6f1eaa9cc.png)

For each class, you have three subclasses, three different paths with their unique abilities. This means you have the Titan, Warlock, and Hunter, which each have Arc, Solar, and Void subclasses, and each of those has three different paths. This alone can be not very clear, so I will make another guide for this and explain what each does and what to pick, and why.

To continue, each of these specific subclasses and paths has their names when you go to select a subclass to play. Hover over one of the subclasses and select it. Then you can change what path, abilities, grenade, and the jump.

![Character UI Subclass Detailed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236639-e304d500-17bb-11eb-9794-564a1fb6e643.png)

# Class Abilities

![Character UI Subclass Abilities](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236630-dbddc700-17bb-11eb-90cf-dbb0dbed4d8e.png)

Each class has its unique abilities as well. You have two options to choose from when selecting an ability, and each has a brief description explaining what each does. The Titan uses a barricade to shield them from incoming damage. The Hunter has a dodge that either reload your weapon or recharges your melee ability. The Warlock has a rift that either heals you as you stand in it or increases weapon damage.

# Grenades

![Character UI Subclass Grenades](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236675-fd3eb300-17bb-11eb-81e8-74b4c4ae81aa.png)

For each class, you have three grenades to choose from, and each does its own unique thing. Just mess around and see which you like or prefer. However, some are better than others or are simply more viable and easier to use.

# Movement Modes

![Character UI Subclass Jump](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236685-062f8480-17bc-11eb-917a-19ae367f647b.png)

Again, for each class, you have three of these to choose from, and each is a bit different. Either giving you better movement in the air, better control, or more lift. This is a personal preference, but you will find that there are situational advantages to each as you play.

# Super Abilities

![Character UI Subclass Trees](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97236701-0b8ccf00-17bc-11eb-89dd-bc500225f9c6.png)

During gameplay, you can use an ultimate/super ability, which allows the player to use offensive, defensive, or support powers. You can find videos explaining which are best in what situations, but I will go over this in a later guide.

# Weapon System

So now, we're going to dive into the weapon system. I am for now going to keep it simple. But you have the following main weapon types.

*NOTE: Some exotics will fit into some categories they normally wouldn't. An example would be Eriana's Vow. This weapon is a Hand Cannon, but it uses green/special ammo. There are others like this as well for the Heavy category.*

* Primary (Uses the white/primary ammo that drops)
  * Assault Rifle
  * Hand Cannon
  * Pulse Rifle
  * Bow
  * Submachine Gun
  * Sidearm
  
* Secondary (Uses the green/special ammo that drops)
  * Grenade Launcher
  * Fusion Rifle
  * Sniper Rifle
  * Shotgun
  * Trace Rifle
  
* Heavy/Power (Uses the purple/heavy ammo)
  * Machine Gun
  * Sword
  * Grenade Launcher 
  * Sniper Rifle
  * Shotgun
  * Rocket Launcher
  * Linear Fusion Rifle
  
*NOTE: There are different types or archetypes of each of these weapons. They each perform differently. Some will fire slower, do more DPS, or have some special trait-like shooting three to five-round bursts each time you pull the trigger. I will cover this at a later point discussing which weapons are best in the slot and link DPS charts as well.*
  
With the weapon system in Destiny 2, Primary and Secondary weapons can fit into either the Kinetic slot or the Energy slot. The heavy weapons listed above stay the same.

# Kinetic Weapons

![Character UI Kinetic Weapon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97347978-e81d5f00-1863-11eb-8596-7dc3f7555c6d.png)

Weapons in the Kinetic slot do not have an elemental burn attached to them. The weapons that fit into this category are Secondary and Primary weapons.

# Energy Weapons

![Character UI Energy Weapon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97348171-2dda2780-1864-11eb-895c-5d73d86dabb1.png)

Weapons in this slot have an elemental burn. They can be one of the three that we previously talked about in the beginning. The weapons that fit into this category are the Primary and the Secondary weapon types.

# Heavy Weapons

![Character UI Power Weapon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97348590-bbb61280-1864-11eb-918d-dd7c1babc67a.png)

These weapons are going to be the ones I listed above in the Heavy/Power category. They only use the heavy (purple) ammo that drops. These weapons normally do a lot of damage and DPS. They can be used during boss phases and or killing supers within the crucible (PvP/Player versus Player).

You can do various builds with each of these weapons to optimize your performance during gameplay. Normally you want to use at least one primary, secondary, and heavy weapon. Another way you can play is simply by using two primary weapons and then a heavy. Honestly, this is just personal preference. To start, just play the game and find weapons you like to use.

# Ghost

The second to last slot on the left side of the character UI is where your ghost is located.

![Character UI Ghost](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97351190-c920cc00-1867-11eb-8189-981f25186150.png)

Your ghost can give you additional attributes. These could include increased XP gain, glimmer gain, identifying items near you on your HUD, rewarding additional faction tokens, or simply looking cool! You can find them during normal gameplay or purchasing them from NPCs/vendors.

# Artifact

![Character UI  Artifact](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97351868-b6f35d80-1868-11eb-9931-cea926be9bea.png)

The last slot on the left is your artifact.

![Character UI Artifact Detailed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97351953-d12d3b80-1868-11eb-9ce1-6aab5d0c5131.png)

When you open the artifact and look at its details, the artifact is where gameplay begins to change a bit. You can find enhanced mods, barrier mods, mods that grant glimmer when killing a certain enemy, and then other mods that do "special" things. These special things could include weakening enemies and or increasing damage.

# Power Level

![Character UI Power Level](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97352937-bdcea000-1869-11eb-8928-21aed29a5a76.png)

Your power level is the combined power value across all of your equipped gear. This will either increase your damage output and defense as you increase your power level. You can increase your power level by completing powerful or pinnacle activities. I will make a guide going over the best ways to approach increasing your power level in detail at a later point.

# Character Stats

When you look to the left of your armor, there is a column of numbers. Each of these numbers corresponds to a stat that impacts your character's gameplay, and each one does something different. We will go through each starting from top to bottom.

Each class has a "Class Stat." This class stat gives you a bonus for increasing the amount of that stat.

For example, in the Hunter class, increasing your Mobility stat will decrease the amount of time it takes for your class's ability to recharge. On the Titan, increasing your Resilience will do the same, and then on the Warlock, increasing your Recovery will do the same as well.

When you increase your stat in one of the categories, you will increase its tier. There are ten tiers for a stat. Tier 1 is from 1-10, Tier 2 is from 11-20, and so on. Say if you have a stat roll of 75 in Mobility that means your Mobility is in Tier 7. Although your roll is 75, you do not get credit for the five over Tier 7. If your stat roll is 79, you only get credit for 70. You could think of it this way. Divide your stat roll by ten and then ignore the remainder, and that is what tier your stat roll is in.

Increasing a specific stat will increase something from its base value or decrease its cooldown rate or recharge rate. We will now go over exactly what those somethings are for each stat.

**Mobility**

![Character UI Mobility](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97353481-7c8ac000-186a-11eb-9664-ffa552c0c1de.png)

This stat increases your movement speed and maximum jump height. If you hover above Mobility, it will tell you how much the base speed is increased by.

**Resilience**

![Character UI Resilience](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97355102-d2f8fe00-186c-11eb-9c10-f23eca06de95.png)

This stat increases the amount of damage you can take before dying. As you increase this stat, it simply increases the shield capacity.

**Recovery**

![Character UI Recovery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97355106-d4c2c180-186c-11eb-8cc7-447098db0473.png)

This stat increases the speed at which you regain lost health. As you increase this stat you increase the recovery rate of your health.

**Discipline**

![Character UI Discipline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97355149-dee4c000-186c-11eb-8c32-fcd9923fae4b.png)

This stat decreases the cooldown time of your grenades, allowing you to use them more often. 

**Intellect**

![Character UI Intellect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97355157-e2784700-186c-11eb-88bf-2b83ff4cd1f4.png)

This stat decreases the cooldown of your Super ability, allowing you to use it more often. 

**Strength**

![Character UI Strength](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97355114-d68c8500-186c-11eb-8502-1f35687ce19c.png)

This stat decreases the cooldown time of your ability, allowing you to use it more often.

# Armor

You have five different pieces of armor. You have your helmet, arms, chest, legs, and class item. Now with armor, you can only equip one Exotic piece at a time. Additionally, with armor, each one has its mods. For example, the mods you can equip on your helmet will not be the same mods on your arms. Also, depending on the elemental burn of said armor will affect the type of mods you can equip. This will require a more in-depth guide to understand, and will do this at a later point.

Your armor is what directly affects what stats you have on your character. This is likely the most important thing to gain from understanding how armor works. The stat rolls given on your armor is completely randomly rolled, and you have no control of this. With luck and time, you can earn armor with the stats you want to create builds that you want for a specific role in the game.

# Clan Banner

![Character UI Clan Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72057076/97377381-45320880-1896-11eb-808a-01f5815edc80.png)

Your clan banner is likely the least important thing on the character UI, in my opinion. This simply tells you what perks you and your clan have unlocked so far within the season. Besides that, the clan banner is pointless.
